# VERSION (development)

## User visible changes

In order to have a more complete AUCTeX and RefTeX setup, the
environment variables TEXINPUTS and BIBINPUTS are now also imported
from the shell at startup. Therefore, the following environment
variables are imported at startup by default: PATH, MANPATH, LANG,
TEXINPUTS, BIBINPUTS.

## User visible changes

- In `site-start.el`, `ess-nuke-trailing-whitespace` is now added to
  the `write-contents-functions` hook to avoid bleeding of the
  functionality to other major modes (most notably markdown, where
  trailing whitespace is sometimes useful).

## Updates

- AUCTeX 11.90

## Updates

# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-7 (15 July 2016)

This is a re-release fixing only the current and the README.txt
files. The 8 May 2016 version of this file should have also included
the following statement.

## User visible changes

- The default configuration has changed as follows:
  ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX is active for Sweave documents using the
  AUCTeX interface; polymode is active only for Rmarkdown (and as a
  by-product for R help files). See threads in the ess-help mailing
  list in April and July 2016 for some rationale for this decision
  (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-help/2016-April/010932.html).

# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-7 (8 May 2016)

## Updates

- ESS 16.04


# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-6 (30 March 2016)

## New feature

- markdown-mode is now automatically loaded for file extensions
  `.text`, `.markdown` and `.md`.

## Updates

- AUCTeX 11.89
- Org 8.3.4
- markdown-mode 2.1
- polymode 2016-03-24
- exec-path-from-shell 1.10-7


# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-5 (15 December 2015)

## Bug fix

- The patches to psvn.el to support Subversion > v1.7, removed from
  the previous release, are reinstated.


# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-4 (11 December 2015)

## Updates

- ESS 15.09-2


# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-3 (26 October 2015)

## Updates

- ESS 15.09-1
- Org 8.3.2

## (Possibly) User visible change

- import-env-from-shell.el has been replaced by Steve Purcell's
  original exec-path-from-shell.el (on which the latter was based).
  This should have no visible impact except if one has customized
  `import-env-from-shell-variables`: one should now rather customize
  `exec-path-from-shell-variables`.


# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-2 (24 September 2015)

## Updates

- ESS 15.09
- Org 8.3.1
- The invocation (setq command-line-default-directory "~/") has been
  deleted from the site initialization file. It no longer seems to be
  of any use and it interferes with opening a file from the command
  line with Emacs in non-windowed mode (thanks to Ivo Welch
  <ivo.welch@gmail.com> for this catch).


# VERSION 24.5-1-modified-1 (10 May 2015)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 24.5 released April 10, 2015. Actually based on David
  Caldwell's release 24.5-1.


# VERSION 24.4-modified-4 (26 April 2015)

## Updates

- ESS 15.03-1

## User visible changes

- As per an AUCTeX maintainer's recommendation, packages
  initialisation has been moved back from default.el to site-start.el.
  Please report if this causes any problem.

  Config file default.el now only contains invocations for this
  distribution's custom packages `version-modified.el` and
  `import-env-from-shell.el`.


# VERSION 24.4-modified-3 (1 April 2015)

## Updates

- ESS 15.03


# VERSION 24.4-modified-2 (2 February 2015)

## Updates

- AUCTeX 11.88


# VERSION 24.4-modified-1 (21 October 2014)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 24.4 released October 20, 2014.
- org 8.2.10
- `import-env-from-shell` has been updated along Steve Purcell's
  current code for exec-path-from-shell.el. Should work better at
  importing the environment for shells other than bash.

## User visible changes

- New, more modern, icon by Thomas Kobber Panum lifted from the
  emacs-mac-port project. Particularly well suited to OS X Yosemite.
  The `Emacs document` icon is no longer included in the distribution.


# VERSION 24.3.93-modified-5 (15 September 2014)

## New features

- polymode and markdown-mode are now included in the distribution. By
  default, polymode is active for R mode and automaically loaded for
  the following file extensions: .Snw, .Rnw, .Rmd, .rapport, .Rhtml,
  .Rbrew, .Rcpp, .cppR.
- org mode (latest stable release at build time) is reintroduced in
  the distribution.
- All .el files (except configuration files default.el and
  site-start.el) now also ship byte-compiled.

## Updates

- Emacs 24.3.93 pretest build from 2014-08-14 by David Caldwell. This
  non official build has the advantage to include a fix for the
  distnoted problem on OS X 10.9 Mavericks.
- ESS 14.09
- org 8.2.7c


# VERSION 24.3-modified-4 (8 December 2013)

## New feature

- Function and variable `emacs-modified-version` to display and hold
  the distribution version number.

## Updates

- ESS 13.09-1


# VERSION 24.3-modified-3 (27 September 2013)

## Updates

- ESS 13.09


# VERSION 24.3-modified-2 (15 May 2013)

## Updates

- ESS 13.05

## (More of less) User visible changes

- In site-start.el, `inferior-R-args` no longer includes
  "--no-restore-history" as it apparently had no effect. Thanks to
  Vitalie Spinu for the rectification.
- In site-start.el, `ess-default-style` is no longer defined to be
  "C++" since the default indentation style in ESS is now "RRR".


# VERSION 24.3-modified-1 (13 March 2013)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 24.3, released two days ago.
- The application is now code signed. This will ease installation on
  Moutain Lion systems. Thanks to David Caldwell for pointers on how
  to do this.


# VERSION 24.2-modified-7 (23 January 2013)

## Bug fix

- Fixed the startup warning message about org-install being
  deprecated. Unfinished job in previous release.


# VERSION 24.2-modified-6 (18 January 2013)

## User visible change

- Org is *removed* from the distribution as it triggered a warning
  message at Emacs startup. This may seem a rather drastic measure,
  but Org has proved annoying to support as an add-on to the
  distribution. The package may be installed via the Emacs package
  system; see http://orgmode.org/manual/Installation.html. The version
  of Org shipping with GNU Emacs 24.2 is 7.8.11.


# VERSION 24.2-modified-5 (12 January 2013)

## Updates

- ESS 12.09-2
- Org 7.9.3c
- psvn.el is now revision 1369093 of Subversion source code repository
  with Andre Colomb's and Koji Nakamaru's patches to support
  Subversion 1.7; see
  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox//subversion-dev/201208.mbox/%3C503B958F.6010906@schickhardt.org%3E
  The original file appears to actually be *older* than Stefan
  Reichoer's version of 2012-03-26 in some respect, but using the
  Subversion sources version made it easier to apply the patches.

## (More or less) User visible change

Shell environment variables, most notably $PATH, are imported into
Emacs using a different, faster and apparently more reliable
technique.

The previous code (lifted and adapted from Aquamacs) would start a
shell and copy the whole environment using `printenv`. For some
reason, this not seldomly failed and 0 environment variables were
imported.

The new code (adapted from Steve Purcell's exec-path-from-shell.el
<https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell>) instead copies only
the environment variables listed in `import-env-from-shell-variables`.
By default, these are $PATH, $MANPATH and $LANG. If you relied on
other variables being imported into Emacs with previous versions, you
can Customize `import-env-from-shell-variables`, or else append to it
in your .emacs file; see the site-start.el[*] file for an example of how
to do so.

* Typically, this is in
  /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/site-start.el

# VERSION 23.4-modified-4 (6 April 2012)

## Updates

- ESS 12.04
- Org 7.8.08

## Bug fix

- Org was not correctly installed in previous version due to org's
  akward use of environment variable DESTDIR in its Makefile.

## Updates

- ESS 12.03
- Org 7.8.07

  Emacs 23.

  distribution. As of this release, this is version 7.8.03 of
  org-mode.

## (Apparently) User visible change

- File site-start.el is reinstated in the distribution. Loading of
  extension packages is still done in default.el, but customizations
  that I provide [that is, the (setq ...)] are located in
  site-start.el.

  are still 5.14 and 11.86patched, respectively.


# VERSION 23.3-modified-3 (20 August 2011)

## (More or less) User visible change

- File site-start.el renamed to default.el. Therefore, package loading
  and Emacs configuration now happens *after* any user and site
  configuration file is read. The distribution should now behave
  better with users' settings. Thanks to Rodney Sparapani
  <rsparapa@mcw.edu> and Stephen Eglen <S.J.Eglen@damtp.cam.ac.uk> for
  pointers on this issue.


# VERSION 23.3-modified-2 (9 August 2011)

  Caldwell from http://emacsforosx.com. Hence, the architecture is
  dropped from the version number.

## Updates

- ESS 5.14
- AUCTEX 11.86 patched to have version 1.286 of preview.el. This
  solves image creation issues as explained here:

  Thanks to Hans Olav Husum <hohusum@gmail.com> for reporting the
  problem and the solution.

  installation. Contributed by Rodney Sparapani <rsparapa@mcw.edu>.


# VERSION 23.2-modified-1-i386 (11 May 2010)

## Updates

- GNU Emacs 23.2, released May 8, 2010. This is a 32-bit Intel binary
  that should work on OS X 10.4 and above. We now base the
  distribution on the latest stable release of Emacs since it builds
  on Snow Leopard.


# VERSION 23.1.93-modified-4-i386 (16 March 2010)

## New feature

- Introduced the architecture in the distribution name for clarity.

## Bug fix

- I am learning how to compile on OS X... This binary should work on
  10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard) system as well as on 10.6 (Snow
  Leopard). Thanks to Nick Bell <nick.bell@ed.ac.uk> for the heads up
  and testing.


# VERSION 23.1.93-modified-3 (13 March 2010)

## User visible change

- Fixed the default PDF viewer invocation on OS X. Customization
  changed with AUCTeX 11.86 and site-start.el was not adpated
  accordingly.


# VERSION 23.1.93-modified-2 (9 March 2010)

## Bug fix

files:

- ESS 5.4
- AUCTeX 11.85
- psvn.el
- site-start.el

Aspell is no longer included in this distribution (it was broken in
the first place). Consider installing Aspell from Macports
(www.macports.org) of Fink (www.finkproject.org). It is fairly simple
and installing additional dictionnaries is then straightforward.

packages:

- ESS 5.3.10
- AUCTeX 11.85
