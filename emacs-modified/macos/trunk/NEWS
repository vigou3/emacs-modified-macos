=== Modified version of GNU Emacs for Mac OS X ===

Version 23.1.90-modified-1 (3 January 2010)
===========================================

Release compiled from Emacs CVS sources restoring building on Snow
Leopard. This is a 32-bit application that should run on older OS X
releases.

UPDATES

o ESS 5.7.1


Version 23.1-modified-1 (18 August 2009)
========================================

First official release based on GNU Emacs 23.1. Included packages and
files:

o ESS 5.4
o AUCTeX 11.85
o psvn.el
o site-start.el

Aspell is no longer included in this distribution (it was broken in
the first place). Consider installing Aspell from Macports
(www.macports.org) of Fink (www.finkproject.org). It is fairly simple
and installing additional dictionnaries is then straightforward.

packages:

o ESS 5.3.10
