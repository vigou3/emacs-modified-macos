Emacs.app Modified
==================

This is the the NeXTstep-based port of GNU Emacs, known as Emacs.app,
modified to include the following add-on packages:

* ESS 5.3.10;
* AUCTeX 11.85;
* Aspell 0.60.6, a spell checker well integrated to Emacs;
* English (version 6.0-0), French (version 0.50-3) and German (version
  20030222-1) dictionnaries for Aspell. See http://aspell.net to
  install other dictionnaries;
* a fix to include the user path to the 'exec-path' Emacs variable;
* site-start.el, to make everything work.

Emacs.app to Vincent Goulet <vincent.goulet@act.ulaval.ca>.
