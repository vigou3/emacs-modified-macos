Emacs.app Modified
==================

This is the the NeXTstep-based port of GNU Emacs, known as Emacs.app,
modified to include the following add-on packages:

* ESS <ESSVERSION>;
* AUCTeX <AUCTEXVERSION>;
* polymode <POLYMODEVERSION> and markdown-mode <MARKDOWNMODEVERSION>;
* psvn.el r<PSVNVERSION> from Subversion sources, to work with
  Subversion repositories from within Emacs;
* default.el and site-start.el files to make everything work together.

Please direct questions or comments on this modified version of
Emacs.app to Vincent Goulet <vincent.goulet@act.ulaval.ca>.
