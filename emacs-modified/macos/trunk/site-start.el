;;; Nice options to have On by default
;;;
(mouse-wheel-mode t)			; activate mouse scrolling
(global-font-lock-mode t)		; syntax highlighting
(transient-mark-mode t)			; sane select (mark) mode
(delete-selection-mode t)		; entry deletes marked text
(show-paren-mode t)			; match parentheses
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill) ; wrap long lines in text mode

;;; ESS
;;;
;; Load ESS and activate the nifty feature showing function arguments
;; in the minibuffer until the call is closed with ')'.
(require 'ess-site)
(require 'ess-eldoc)

;; Following the "source is real" philosophy put forward by ESS, one
;; should not need the command history and should not save the
;; workspace at the end of an R session. Hence, both options are
;; disabled here.
(setq-default inferior-R-args "--no-restore-history --no-save ")

;; Set code indentation following the standard in R sources.
(setq ess-default-style 'C++)

;; Automagically delete trailing whitespace when saving R script
;; files. One can add other commands in the ess-mode-hook below.

;;; AUCTeX

;; Load AUCTeX and preview-latex.
(load "auctex.el" nil t t)

;; Minimal OS X-friendly configuration of AUCTeX. Since there is no
;; DVI viewer for the platform, use pdftex/pdflatex by default for
;; compilation. Furthermore, use 'open' to view the resulting PDF.
;; Until Preview learns to refresh automatically on file updates, Skim
;; (http://skim-app.sourceforge.net) is a nice PDF viewer.

;;; SVN

;; Support for the Subversion version control system. Use 'M-x

;;; Fix path

;; Emacs does not always properly catch the system and user paths at
;; launch on OS X. I rely on code lifted from Aquamacs to fix this.
;; Cost: 1 second at launch time.
