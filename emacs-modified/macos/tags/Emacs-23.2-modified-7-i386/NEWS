  Leopard). Thanks to Nick Bell <nick.bell@ed.ac.uk> for the heads up
  and testing.

  accordingly.

Version 23.1-modified-1 (18 August 2009)
========================================

First official release based on GNU Emacs 23.1. Included packages and
files:

o ESS 5.4
o AUCTeX 11.85
o psvn.el
o site-start.el

Aspell is no longer included in this distribution (it was broken in
the first place). Consider installing Aspell from Macports
(www.macports.org) of Fink (www.finkproject.org). It is fairly simple
and installing additional dictionnaries is then straightforward.

==============================================

Initial release compiled from CVS sources of GNU Emacs. Included
packages:

o ESS 5.3.10

o English (version 6.0-0), French (version 0.50-3) and German (version
  20030222-1) dictionnaries for Aspell
o psvn.el
o site-start.el
