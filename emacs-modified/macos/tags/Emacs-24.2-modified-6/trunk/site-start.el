;;; Environment setting
;;;
;; By default, environment variables PATH, MANPATH and LANG are
;; imported from the shell at startup. If needed, more variables may
;; be imported by listing them in 'import-env-from-shell-variables'
;; variable. You may also Customize this variable.
;;
;; Customizations should probably go in a user's .emacs file, so just
;; consider the code below as an example of how to do it.
;(setq load-path
;      (nconc '("BIBINPUTS") import-env-from-shell-variables))


;;;
;;; Nice options to have On by default
;;;
(mouse-wheel-mode t)			; activate mouse scrolling
(global-font-lock-mode t)		; syntax highlighting
(transient-mark-mode t)			; sane select (mark) mode
(delete-selection-mode t)		; entry deletes marked text
(show-paren-mode t)			; match parentheses
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill) ; wrap long lines in text mode


;;;
;;; ESS
;;;
;; Following the "source is real" philosophy put forward by ESS, one
;; should not need the command history and should not save the
;; workspace at the end of an R session. Hence, both options are
;; disabled here.
(setq-default inferior-R-args "--no-restore-history --no-save ")

;; Set code indentation following the standard in R sources.
(setq ess-default-style 'C++)

;; Automagically delete trailing whitespace when saving R script
;; files. One can add other commands in the ess-mode-hook below.
(add-hook 'ess-mode-hook
	  '(lambda()
	     (add-hook 'write-file-functions
		       (lambda ()
                         (ess-nuke-trailing-whitespace)))
	     (setq ess-nuke-trailing-whitespace-p t)))

	    (setq reftex-plug-into-AUCTeX t)))

;; Minimal OS X-friendly configuration of AUCTeX. Since there is no
;; DVI viewer for the platform, use pdftex/pdflatex by default for
;; compilation. Furthermore, use 'open' to view the resulting PDF.
;; Until Preview learns to refresh automatically on file updates, Skim
;; (http://skim-app.sourceforge.net) is a nice PDF viewer.
(setq TeX-PDF-mode t)

      '(("dvips and PDF Viewer" "%(o?)dvips %d -o && open %f")
	("PDF Viewer" "open %o")
	("Safari" "open %o")))

;; Add standard Sweave file extensions to the list of files recognized
;; by AUCTeX.

;;; SVN
;;;
;; Support for the Subversion version control system. Use 'M-x
;; svn-status RET' on a directory under version control to update,
;; commit changes, revert files, etc., all within Emacs.
